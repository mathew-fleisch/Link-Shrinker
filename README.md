# Link Shrinker

This application is similar to bit.ly where any user can submit a url, and it will give them back a shortened url that  automatically redirects, to the original url. 

This version was written in PHP using CodeIgniter v3.1.4, and uses Javascript/jQuery on the front-end. The design comes from a free bootstrap theme, called '[cyborg](https://bootswatch.com/cyborg/)', to give it a standard look-and-feel. Each url first passes through a [phishtank](https://www.phishtank.com/) blacklist, to prevent known malicious urls from getting into the system.
